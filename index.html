       <p>  Hello, my name is Oswal Gonzalez and I am an aspiring software developer. I currently attend Seattle Central College where I am pursuing a Software Development Certification. I am also studying Business Communications because I believe that having those skills will help me stand out and be successful in my future career. When I am not studying I keep myself busy with hobbies that keep me active, whether that be playing sports like soccer or tennis, hiking or kayaking or even photography. I am someone that really values friends and family and self improvement. I believe that you should always work hard at your goals but also work hard on improving yourself personally in order to become the best version of yourself. I have a few years of experience in the workforce and I have shaped the skills I learned at these past jobs to make my skill set unique. I have worked at companies like Ford Motor Company and Comcast where I developed my sales and interpersonal communication skills. Most enjoyably, I worked as a Spanish teacher assistant at a different college where I developed Leadership and teaching skills. My plan is to take this blend of different experiences and apply them once I enter the world of tech.</p>
